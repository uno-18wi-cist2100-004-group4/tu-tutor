Vimeo, a video hosting business, would be our business partner so TuTutoring can facillitate video tutoring.
Vimeo allows for the customization of the video player so we fit our needs more than an uncustomizable system would. 
### PayPal/Venmo:
PayPal and Venmo, online payment services, will integrate with the TuTutoring mobile app and website to provide easy and secure payment solutions for our service.
### Web Development Firm:
To get started, we need a solid foundation. Partnering with a web development firm to establish our web presence is critical to having a functional online business. This web development firm will create the initial backend and front end systems for the website. As the business grows, this firm will no longer be required as we will take the web development in house.
### Mobile App Development Firm:
Similar to the web development firm, we will need assistance to develop the solid foundation for our mobile application. The mobile app development firm will work together with the web development firm to create a tight integration between the website and mobile app for a consistent experience.
