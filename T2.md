A flagging/reporting feature will be avaliable to both students and tutors in the event that a customer violates any user guidlines. 

### Value
We deliver value to our customer by being a quick, easy, and accessible way to connect tutors and students. By facilitating affordable and fair priced tutoring sessions that work within the customers' schedules, we give customers a better way to study and to build off of their educational successes.

## Maintaining Customer Relationships

### Customer Segments

We would find tutors that match the personality of the college students and would be largely beneficial to keeping the customer segment connected. Reviews and ratings would also greatly help other students who are looking for good quality tutors. Recommending TuTutoring to friends could get you a discount on whichever service you're looking for.

### Support

Tu Tutoring will provide support through email services for customer service, 
technical issues, and other customer issues. While TuTutoring only offers
email support for now, other options will become available as the company
expands.

We will increase our customer awareness using social media and on-campus advertising. Through social media we will be able to reach out to our customers and potentail new customers by keeping them up-to-date on what TuTutor has to offer.

### Our Relationship with the Customer

TuTutor provides a relationship to the customer that revolves around them and their schedule. Customers say what time they want a tutor and we match them with a tutor for that time. Our Tutuors have good comunication skills and have the ability to work with many different people, making the students lives easier. We're the bridge that connects the tutors and the students together!

Customers first begin their experience with TuTutoring by creating an account to receive one free session with a tutor of their choice to give students a glimpse of what the service has to offer. After this one free session, students are prompted to purchase "credits" to continue using TuTutoring. One credit equivilant to one session. Students can pay for these credits through either Venmo or PayPal payment services.
