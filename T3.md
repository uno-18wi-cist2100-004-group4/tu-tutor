## Key Resources for Online Buisness 
The online business resources for TuTutoring consists of a cloud based website hosted within Amazon Web Services (AWS). The high availablility of AWS and nearly instant infrastructure creation of the service allows TuTutoring to not require any on premises hardware that is critical to the functionality of the service.

As the TuTutoring service is developed, the server software will be developed within a Docker container for easy portability between cloud services should we choose to switch to another provider. All elements, database, front and back ends, will be hosted within dedicated docker, database, and application AWS services for high performance within the AWS cloud.

For internal business use, all of our software developers will use high performance workstations equipped with the latest versions of macOS and Xcode along with a Windows virtual machine with Visual Studio installed. Code compilation and version control would be hosted in Atlassian BitBucket for easy integration with Trello project management and Slack team communication utilities. Only basic networking infrastructure is required at the headquarters as all services required by the company is cloud based. Lastly, business administrators will use desktop computers equipped with high end business software to run the business efficiently and smoothly.
