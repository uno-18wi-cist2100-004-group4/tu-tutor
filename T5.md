### Three Year Plan
Based on the inital cost and revenue structures of Tututoring, the following three years will be focused on gathering increased financial backing, through investers, and modest business expansion. Expansion of TuTutoring to more campuses will increase the revenue from both customers and advertisers on our site. By seeking out investers TuTutoring can increase its abilities and reach while not running an excessive loss. 
Like most start ups, TuTutoring does not expect to turn a profit in the next three years, and we are hopeful that it can be a sucessful start up.
